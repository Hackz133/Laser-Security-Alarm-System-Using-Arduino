# Laser Security Alarm System (IoT)

An IoT-based security system developed using Arduino and a laser sensor to detect unauthorized entry.

## Project Description
This project continuously monitors a laser beam focused on a photo sensor.  
When the beam is interrupted, the microcontroller detects intrusion and activates a buzzer alarm.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Laser Module
- LDR / Photo Sensor
- Buzzer
- Resistors and connecting wires

## Working Principle
The laser light falls on the sensor creating a stable signal.  
If an object interrupts the beam, the signal changes and Arduino triggers the buzzer to alert intrusion.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- Embedded C/C++
- Sensors & Actuators
- Hardware Interfacing

## Features
- Real-time intrusion detection
- Instant buzzer alert
- Low cost security system
- Easy to install and maintain

## Demo Video
The working demonstration video is available in this repository.
